# Doer? What is this?

Doer is just a little note taking app in pure js that I made for learning purposes.

# Future plans

1. Project settings and filters
2. Timer, time-bar and worklog page for tracking time spent on note
3. Start and due time of the note and project
4. Responsive Design
5. Dark theme
